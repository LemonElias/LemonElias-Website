## Information

<p>I have always wanted to have my own website and now that I am starting to get into coding I thought this would be one of my first projects to start. Now here we are. LemonElias website is a project where I want to build up some html, css and js knowledge until I can finish this website with all the things I want. You are all invited to improve my code or comment on things I can fix or upgrade to make the website complete one day. In the following section I will write a coding diary where I will document my steps in the process and my goals for the future. I will also make a folder with the next steps I want to implement on the page, so you have the possibility to comment on how I can do that or give me snippets of code that would work well with that idea. Anyway enough of the talk, you can visit my site <span><a href="www.lemonelias.de">here</a></span> if its already online!
